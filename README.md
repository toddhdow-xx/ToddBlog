ToddHDow.com - an alternative to WordPress

Perhaps I'll do a site redesign to replace my toddhdow.com site that is currently hosted on Wordpress.

I really like the layout of this site:
http://www.igvita.com/
I'd like to a rendition of that site.
It appears to be responsive.
It has commenting via Disqus.
It looks fantastic and is minimalist.

Perhaps... one day...

Until then, this is a placeholder.
